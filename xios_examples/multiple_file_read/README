read_domain_resample
--------------------

These examples read in arbitrary data from a netCDF file and resample to a different horizontal domain as defined within the input netCDF file using bilinear interpolation.
The original and resampled data as well as a diff between them are written to one output NetCDF file. The unit tests include two known failure test cases where the expected result is not produced.
